if you request the image data please send email to me:

email address: xingshuli600@gmail.com

2. Four types of CNN:

VGG-16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3 with Identity mapping (Inception-ResNet-V3), Xception

3. Environment Configuration:

Anaconda --4.1.0

Keras --2.0.7

Tensorflow--1.3 (GPU GTX1080Ti)

The check.py file is used to check the misclassification images and output real_index and target_index
Note: the preprocessing of each test images is img/=255
